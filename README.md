# O UGANDANs

### This is a creative, political, informative and danceable song/music project by the [Uganda] Internet President 

The final song is based on a soundtrack production by [DRU]MAZERA the melodic metal band from Uganda, as well as various actual historical audio recordings of speeches and interviews by Ugandan Presidents. It somewhat feels like it features the BATEMBUZYI, but that's because some of that group's members performed the written speeches of the IP for this project.

The song is meant to help inform Ugandans about the diversity across past and present Ugandan Presidents, especially sovereign presidents that is, as well as inspire more people to want to participate in the Presidency of their sovereign nation come 2026 and beyond...

This is a formal production by the NML: Nuchwezi Media Lab, in 2024.
